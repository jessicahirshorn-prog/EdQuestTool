<tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Start" tags="" position="100,100" size="100,100">Welcome to this learning scenario about **Scientific Method in Research**.

**Learning Objectives:**
• Identify the steps of the scientific method
• Formulate testable hypotheses from observations
• Design controlled experiments with appropriate variables
• Analyze data and draw evidence-based conclusions

You will encounter situations where you need to apply your understanding of these concepts. Your choices will demonstrate your grasp of the material.

**Assessment Criteria:** Students should demonstrate the ability to apply each step of the scientific method to a novel research scenario, making choices that reflect systematic, evidence-based reasoning rather than assumptions or shortcuts.
